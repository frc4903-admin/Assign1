look at the following:
	< joystickMain > definitions:
		how it's defined (beware! it's defined in two places)
		the functions that are used from it
	look at the TalonSRX:
		beware that we have two talons for each side in the original code but you only need one
		the function TalonSRX.Set()


* watch out for includes *
